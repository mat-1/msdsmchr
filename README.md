# mat's super duper simple minecraft head renderer

All the other head rendering APIs suck (incorrect rendering, no/bad overlays, slow, buggy), so I made one that doesn't.

https://h.matdoes.dev (example usage is on the index page)

This runs on Cloudflare Workers, but is heavily optimized in order to be able to execute in under 10 milliseconds.

Some math from [Crafthead](https://github.com/astei/crafthead).
